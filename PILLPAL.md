# PILLPAL

<!-- My board is an NFC card that directs users to my app, PillPal. PillPal is an app I created to help the elderly take their medications on time. Creating these PCBs will allow me to harness my creative potential. Thank you to Hack Club for all the beautiful opportunities I have been given in these short months I have been a part of it. -->

<!-- It will cost $19.80 for the 5 nfc cards. -->
